# Release Notes - v0.6.1

**Release Date:** February 2026
**Type:** Patch release

---

## Summary

Version 0.6.1 ships streaming reliability fixes and orchestration improvements validated across Synapse and Databricks system tests.

This patch focuses on restart behavior, multi-input streaming conventions, and thread-safe recovery state handling.

---

## Highlights

- Streaming query restart now resolves both logical query IDs and Spark runtime query IDs.
- Streaming recovery flow updated to reduce lock contention and improve thread safety under concurrent recovery processing.
- Streaming pipe execution now supports the convention of one streaming input plus additional static lookup/join inputs.
- Streaming output invocation is normalized to `append_as_stream(df, entity, checkpoint)` for provider consistency.
- System tests now validate restart-by-spark-id and multi-input lookup join scenarios.
